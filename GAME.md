# Command(null)

An agent-based tower defense game where towers consist of modular assemblies and
their AI is provided by code written by the player.

Each tower is equipped based on the resource prioritization specified by the
player. On its turn it can use the resources assigned to it to determine what,
if any, action it should take.

For example, in the case of a gun, the action would be a firing solution (angle,
power, and so on) and, optionally, an instruction to fire.
